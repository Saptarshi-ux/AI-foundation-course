# AI-foundation-course
The AI for Beginners course by HP Foundation offers a comprehensive understanding of AI concepts, their evolution, and their impact on industries, emphasizing ethical considerations and practical applications.
I recently completed the AI for Beginners certification from HP Foundation, which provided a comprehensive understanding of foundational AI concepts, including the history of AI, the differences between Narrow and General AI, and the role of data in AI systems. I learned about data collection methods (surveys, sensors, web scraping), data processing, and data cleaning, along with the significance of big data. The course covered key machine learning concepts—supervised and unsupervised learning, training data, algorithms, and model building—and explained deep learning and neural networks in the context of modern applications like LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT, Google Gemini). A major takeaway was the importance of ethics and bias mitigation in AI, especially how biased data or flawed models can lead to unfair outcomes. It also explored AI's use in professional development through tools like Jobscan, Grammarly, and Interview Warmup. This course strengthened my ability to apply AI responsibly in corporate environments and complements my technical expertise in Power BI, SQL, R, and machine learning, equipping me to build fair, data-driven, and innovative solutions in the workplace.
